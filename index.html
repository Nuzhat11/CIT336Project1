		<h3> About Me </h3>
			<p> My name is Nuzhat Chetona Bhuiyan. I am originally from Bangladesh. I have lived there until I was 12. I lived in Texas for a year, from there, I moved to New Jersey. I lived in New Jersey for 5 years. I got accepted to Pace University after graduating from high school, and I moved to New York for college. </p>
			<p> I am an only child. When I tell people that, I often get asked if I ever felt alone. I didnt: Mainly because growing up, I liked playing, drawing by myself. Also because never knew how it would be to have a sibling.</p>
			<p> In addition to English, I speak Bangla and Hindi fluently.</p>
			<p> In Pace University, my major is MIS, and my minor is Business Management. I have dormed in Pace University for my first two years, and had the most incredible time living the city life. Due to some unfortunate events, I had to take a year and a half off. During which, I moved to Queens. After my time off, now I am finally back to Pace trying to complete my undergrad. </p>

		 <h3> My Interests </h3>
		 <li> Movies </li>
		 	I take time to watch a lot of movies. I enjoy most kind of movies as long as it has a good story-line. One genrea I probably do not enjoy is Comedy. Don't get me wrong, I am not a dark person. Infact, I smile and laugh all the time. I just find comedies trying too hard to make people laugh, and that does not work on me. 
		 	<p>
		 	<li> Read </li>
		 	Reading is something I have always enjoyed. Since I now live in Queens, I have a long commute to college. I get a lot of my reading done on the train during my commute. If I don't have any readings I have to do for school, I read for fun. I finish at least a book every month. All my books are hardcover. In the near future, when I have a job and my own place, I want to have a little library. The novel I am currently reading is called "The Program". 
<p>
		 	Last week, I finished reading a poetry book written by my friend, Hana Malik, called Raw. Hana also attends Pace University. My favorite poem from the book is called "How to Forgive".

			 		<br>
			 		Forgivness is <br> taking the knife out your own back <br> and not using it <br> to hurt anyone else <br> no matter how <br> they hurt you

		 	<li> Dance </li>
				 Dancing has been a part of my life for as long as I can remember. Coming to Pace, I joined the Bollywood dance team - Shakti. A year into it, I became the president/captain. We performed in different colleges, took part in competitions.
